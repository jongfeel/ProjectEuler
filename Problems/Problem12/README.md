# Problem 12

## Highly divisible triangular number

> The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

> Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

 1: 1\
 3: 1,3\
 6: 1,2,3,6\
10: 1,2,5,10\
15: 1,3,5,15\
21: 1,3,7,21\
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

> We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.\
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
